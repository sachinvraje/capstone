#### Dear Reader,
As part of the Data Science Specialisation course from Coursera, this Shiny app is developed for the Capstone project. The goal of this Shiny app is to build a predictive text model that will predict the next word as the user types a sentence. The app considers the last 3 words typed, and predicts the next word, based on the SwiftKey data available. The data helped us build uni-gram, bi-gram and tri-gram datasets. These are used for predicting the next word.

#### Steps
1. Upon initial load up of the application, **"NULL"** will be displayed at the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2. User may then enter a partially complete sentence to begin the next word prediction.

#### Results
1. Next word predicted is shown at the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2. Information on the n-gram backoff algorithm used to predict is shown as indication.

#### Note:
1. The source codes for ui.R, server.R and other files are available on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sachinvraje/capstone)
2. Presentation Slide decks are available on the [RPubs page](http://rpubs.com/sachinvraje/capstone)
3. Working application can be accessed via [Shiny App](https://sachinvraje.shinyapps.io/capstone/)

Thank You

Regards
